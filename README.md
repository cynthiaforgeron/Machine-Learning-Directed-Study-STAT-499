## Statistical Machine Learning Study 

Github repository to monitor progress on my statistical machine learning directed study, supervised by Dr. Jacob Levman at St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova Scotia.

## Outline (from Academic Calendar)

Written by **Dr. Jacob Levman**.

The student will learn theory and practice of the application of
statistical learning technologies in medical imaging. The student
will learn methods of statistical validation, and statistical
analysis of learning technologies. The student will learn the
theory and practical application side of the use of feature
selection technologies for reducing large datasets to workable
quantities of biomarker measurements upon which predictive
statistical inference can be reliably performed. The effects of
sample size in biomedical applications will be researched and
investigated. If deemed necessary, the student will become
affiliated with my Compute Canada account and learn to access
high performance clusters for rapid processing of brain MRI
examinations. High performance workstations are also available
in my laboratory in support of this planned educational research
project.
